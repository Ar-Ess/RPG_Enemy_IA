# What is AI in RPG games actually?

Nowadays, the RPG world is in fight, all the companies wants to make something unique based in the roleplay of a character, and how the player interacts with it in order to achieve its final mission to successfully end the game. In those games, as the main name says, the player needs to feel like it is the real character in that specific situation, so the player needs intelligent inputs from outside (not just the character) in order to achieve that realism.

Here is when AI is coming to help us, to make things seems to dicede by its own, things be realistic and not feeling you are the only one alive there! So what we can understand as AI in enemies (or even NPC)? 

  - AI in enemies occurs when through an algorithm, the entity can decide, act or give a response by itself without any kinf of player input.
